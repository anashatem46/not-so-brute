# üéâ Not-So-Brute: Weekly Algorithm & Data Structure Practice

Welcome to **Not-So-Brute**, where coding meets fun! This repository is my personal playground for solving algorithm and data structure problems. The goal is to practice, learn, and improve while keeping things lighthearted and fun. Each week, I tackle new challenges to strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures in a practical, hands-on way.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `/Solution`: A collection of my weekly algorithmic solutions, each categorized by problem type or concept.
- `template.cpp`: A starter template to help me quickly start solving a new problem.
- Compiled executables (e.g., `Search`, `singleNum`): Results of compiling and running specific solutions.
- `.vscode`: VS Code configuration settings for a smooth coding experience.

## üöÄ How to Get Started

### Prerequisites

To dive into the fun, you'll need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- A basic understanding of C++ and algorithms (or just a curiosity to learn!)
  
### Compiling & Running Solutions

You can easily compile and run the solutions. Here's how:

```bash
# Compile a specific solution
g++ -std=c++17 -o output_name source_file.cpp

# Run the compiled solution
./output_name
```

### Using the Template

Starting a new solution? Just copy the provided template:

```bash
cp template.cpp Solution/your_new_solution.cpp
```

Now you can get coding! 

## üß≠ Navigation

Each solution in `/Solution` is organized by the type of problem it solves or the concept it focuses on. Inside each file, you'll find:

- A problem statement and description
- Approach/algorithm explanation
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Implementation in C++

### Weekly Challenges

Each week I tackle new problems to keep things fresh and exciting. Check the latest problems I've solved or contribute your own solutions by submitting a pull request.

## üéØ Why "Not-So-Brute"?

The idea behind this repo is to focus on improving problem-solving skills, not just brute-forcing through problems. It's about finding elegant, efficient solutions while having fun with the journey. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
